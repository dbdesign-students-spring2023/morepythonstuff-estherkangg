```

### SQL queries

This section shows the SQL queries that you determined solved each of the given problems.

1. Write two SQL commands to create two tables named `hotspots` and `populations`.

```sql
Place your first command here.
```

```sql
Place your second command here.
```

```sql
Place your first command(s) here.
```

```sql
Place your second command(s) here.
```

3. Display the five zip codes with the most Wi-Fi hotspots and the number of Wi-Fi-hotspots in each in descending order of the number of Wi-Fi-hotspots.

```sql
Place your query here.
```

4. Display a list of the name, location, and zip code for all of the free Wi-Fi locations provided by `ALTICEUSA` in Bronx, in descending order of zip code.

```sql

### Normalization and Entity-relationship diagramming

This section contains responses to the questions on normalization and entity-relationship diagramming.

1. Is the data in `wifi.csv` in fourth normal form?

```
Enter your response here
```

2. Explain why or why not the `wifi.csv` data meets 4NF.

```
Enter your response here
```

3. Is the data in `neighborhood_populations.csv` in fourth normal form?

```
Enter your response here
```

4. Explain why or why not the `neighborhood_populations.csv` data meets 4NF.

```
Enter your response here
```

5. Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to draw an Entity-Relationship Diagram showing a 4NF-compliant form of this data, including primary key field(s), relationship(s), and cardinality.
